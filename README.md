## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
This dataset is sourced from [Stack Overflow](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey). In May 2023, more than 90,000 developers participated in the annual Stack Overflow survey, sharing insights on their learning and development journey, preferred tools, and future aspirations.

## Business Understanding <a name="business"></a>
In this notebook, I want to use the Stack Overflow 2023 dataset to find some insight between Asian Countries and the United States. Since I just started learning to code about half a year ago, I want to know which languages and AI tools are more popular.

There will be three questions I will seek to answer to get this information:

1. What are the top 10 programming languages that developers in Asian countries and the United States of America want to work with next year?

2. What is the difference that the developer wants to use AI-powered search tools next year between Asian countries and the United States?

3. What is the difference in time developers spend in Asia and the United States searching for solutions to work-related problems?

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
You need to be able to work in a Jupyter Notebook on your computer. The following packages (libraries) need to be installed. You can install these packages via conda or pip.

- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- jupyterthemes

You will need to download Stack Overflowâ€™s 2023 Annual Developer Survey and put in specific folders. You can find the data to download [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey). 

## Results <a name="results"></a>
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](). 

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>
Must give credit to Stackoverflow for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Stackoverflow link available [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey).
